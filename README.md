# colaboratory-local
This repo allows for a convenient way to create a local notebook runtime. 

A secondary benefit is that Google Colaboratory can connect to it ([these steps](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) are implemented). Chrome works best for Colaboratory but if you use Firefox, remember to set `network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS=true`.
